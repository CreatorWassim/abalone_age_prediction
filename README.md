# Abalone Age Prediction

This repository contains the code for my participation in the Kaggle competition "Playground Series - S4E4". The goal of the competition was to predict the age of abalone based on various physical measurements.

## Overview

In this competition, I experimented with over 8 different machine learning models, including:

- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machine
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost
- Gradient Boost
- XGBoost

![Results](https://github.com/CreatorWassim/abalone_age_prediction/blob/main/results.png)

I didn't spend much time tuning the hyperparameters of these models, as my main goal was to familiarize myself with the machine learning process. Despite minimal tuning, the Gradient Boost model performed the best with an RMSLE score of 0.14862.
